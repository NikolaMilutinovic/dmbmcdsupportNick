                  DMB Support team also handles visits that were done by the
                  Deployment team, and were incomplete and/or completed with
                  issues, for an example: <br />-4 out of 6 Displays replaced on
                  first visit

                  <br />
                  -1 out of 4 Displays Dead on Arrival/Out of Box failure
                  (DOA/OBF)

                  <br />-Display replaced, cables non-functional (Could be any
                  hardware and/or cables)

                  <br />
                  -Displays installed into wrong positions
                </p>
                <p>
                  The visit should be investigated, to determine the outcome,
                  and apply appropriate solutions, to have the remaining issues
                  solved. <br />Here is a guide on how to handle different
                  processess: <br />
                </p>
                <h2>Not all Displays replaced</h2>

                <br />

                <p>
                  Check if all of the hardware was sent and deliverd through the
                  Samsung B2B portal, <br />and check the excel base Michael Sei
                  Tejpal is sending every day, where all of the shipped Samsung
                  screens are located. <br />If the screens are Stratacaches
                  AUO/LG screens, it can be checked with the FedEx tracking
                  and/or Day 2 Shipped Smartsheet.
                  <br />
                  If delivery was completed, schedule technicians to replace the
                  screen.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Dead on Arrival/Out of Box failure hardware:</h2>
                <p>
                  If the screen is a Samsung screen, a replacement unit can be
                  ordered through the Samsung B2B portal, track and schedule
                  technicians when delivered, while updating the snow with the
                  current state of the ticket. <br />If the screen is an AUO/LG
                  unit, or a Media Player or cables, a gratis order should be
                  sent to the sales team, if technicians didnt take all of the
                  pictures needed where Stratacache approved to send a
                  replacement unit.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Display replaced, other hardware non-functional:</h2>
                <p>
                  If, for an example, the Display was replaced, and it was
                  identified that the HDMI cable is also an issue, a new Sales
                  request should be made for the hardware.
                </p>
                <br />

                <h2>Display installed into wrong positions:</h2>

                <p>
                  It should be identified where the screens where the screens
                  were installed, and technicians should be scheduled to swap
                  and install Displays into correct enclosures. <br />If the
                  Displays are Stratacache AUO screens, it should be noted that
                  old LG and new AUO screens shouldnt be in the same enclosure.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Enclosure issues:</h2>
                <p>
                  If the enclosure has issues preventing the installation from
                  taking place, the issues should be dealt with, if possible.<br />
                  For stripped screws, technicians should be scheduled and
                  informed beforehand that they should bring tools needed to
                  remove stripped screws. <br />For any clearance issues,
                  preventing the enclososure to be fully opened due to something
                  blocking the path, the store should be informed to try and
                  resolve that issue.
