                  <h3>A guide on Coates enclosures</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                  Coates screens are always 55” Samsung Outdoor screens, which
                  we receive either through Atos, already ordered under a Case
                  C1234567, or we order them through the Samsung B2B portal, if
                  in-warranty. <br />If out of warranty, Atos incident is sent
                  to Coates for quote and remediate. (Physical damage issues are
                  considered out of warranty also).
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the Display has been replaced, a pick-up is requested
                  through the Samsung B2B portal, and Atos & Snow tickets are
                  updated on that matter, and closed.
                  <br />
                  All Coates in-warranty hardware should be returned to the
                  warehouse through a pick-up process done after the replacement
                  is completed.
                  <br />
                  Regarding enclosure issues, and Eyebolt issue (which is
                  usually sent to us through a Sales request), Coates is the one
                  handling that.
                  <br />
                  To request a pick-up, after searching with the case number,
                  and locating the screen, in the right side of that request,
                  there is a field called “pick-up request” where a pick-up date
                  can be entered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To order a new screen, click on New, and select the following:

                  <br />Business name: Main BP McDonalds

                  <br />Store: (store number)

                  <br />Case type: FT, FT/WG <br />
                  After that, press Create, and a Samsung Case will be created.
                  <br />In it, at the bottom right side, where will be an option
                  to order multiple screens. <br />At the product information,
                  press New button, and enter the following: <br />Serial #:
                  (More on this below) <br />Symptoms: (Select appropriate)
                  <br />Attachment: (Add a picture of the screen) <br />Problem
                  Description: (Root cause of the problem) In the Serial number
                  field, after pressing Check, most of the things will be
                  auto-filled, along with the warranty expiration date, so this
                  is a good way of checking the warranty of the equipment.
                  <br />If any equipment is not picked up, even after requesting
                  a pick-up, escalate with an email to USSI, and add Case#,
                  Ticket#, Serial#, Store# If any equipment has not been
                  shipped, escalate to SamsungB2BSupport with an email, and
                  request an update.
                </p>
                <h2>Stratacache</h2>
                <h3>A guide on Stratacache enclosures</h3>
                <p>
                  Stratacache Displays are either indoor 49” LG screens, or
                  outdoor 55” LG(old) or AUO(new) Displays, where LG and AUO
                  screens should not be in the same enclosure, as per
                  Stratacache. <br />The equipment is most usually processed as
                  an out-of-warranty request that we send to the Sales team for
                  a quote. <br />There are in-warranty request, which are rare,
                  but they come through an Atos ticket. <br />All of the
                  Stratacache hardware is replaced by NCR. For a pick-up, a
                  return label should come, along with the boxed hardware.
                  <br />If not, the customer would need to obtain it through
                  Stratacache.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For an out-of-warranty request, the hardware does not need to
                  be returned, and can be disposed of by the store, according to
                  the local laws/rules on hardware disposal. <br />Stratacache
                  enclosures are opened by two set of keys, and the enclosure
                  contains multiple different parts, which can all be replaced
                  by NCR.
