                  Further troubleshooting is required to determine the cause of
                  failure. <br />
                  Check for any physical damage. <br />If there is physical
                  damage, please note that with any pictures Check to see if
                  screen has power. <br />If not, double check the power outlet
                  and power cable. <br />Use Samsung remote to check menu/power
                  (Screen power can be checked if the infrared sensor light is
                  lit when the screen is powered off and connected to power).
                  <br />If screen powers on with remote, use remote to check if
                  the Menu appears and is visible. <br />Recommended step: Turn
                  the ODMBs breaker off for a couple of minutes and then back
                  on. <br />Use a working HDMI cable from another screen or
                  board to see if that fixes the issue. <br />If yes, then the
                  store needs to order a new HDMI cable.

                  the above steps do not fix the issue, the screen is power

                <p>Best way to handle this issue is to schedule a revisit, and inform the technicians to bring tools required for a stripped screw situation beforehand. <br />
Remove the side panels, top panel, and bottom panel. <br />
Remove the screen that does not have the rusted screw from the enclosure.<br /> 
Keep the all 4  bolts in the screen with the rusted screws attached to keep screen secure to the frame.  <br />
Remove the 4 screws holding the bottom bracket to the post. <br />
Support the bottom bracket which should be able to move with only the two bolts attached from the screen with the rusted screw. <br />
Carefully loosen the top two bolts on the screen while supporting the bottom bracket and screen. Once the bolts are loosened but not removed, lift up and pull the screens out. <br />Alternatively the top two bolts could be completely removed if determined to be easier by the tech.  </p>

                  The base of the bracket on the TV is too wide for the pintle in the case. <br />We just loosened the four bolts on the bracket on the TV 	      and squeezed it together, then tightened the bolts. <br />This made the brackets narrower and allowed the TV to slide into place in the case
