                </header>

                <p>
                  Snow cases are created by L2 DMB Support team either for the
                  Deployment team to install the already ordered screens, or the
                  L2 DMB Support team for further troubleshooting and
                  investigation. <br />
                  The first visit can be successful, without issues, where a
                  pick-up is requested if possible, and Snow and Atos tickets
                  are closed, or it can be completed with issues, where a
                  re-visit is scheduled, and Snow case is updated. <br />Once an
                  Atos ticket gets assigned to VDR:NCR-DMB, and it contains the
                  notes that Displays have been ordered and approved through the
                  Samsung portal, a SNOW Case is created with the following
                  template: <br />Store Number: (Store Number) <br />Account:
                  (MCN number of the store, gathered from the Master Restaurant
                  List) <br />Primary Contact: (After selecting Account, press
                  the magnifying glass, choose a contact) <br />Assignment
                  Group: 31 CCC Deployment <br />Initiative: (Atos INC number)
                  <br />Overall Case State: Starting <br />Program: DMB
                  Move/Add/Change (MAC) <br />Planned Install Type: NCR
                  Professional Install <br />Planned Install State: Deliverables
                  Pending <br />Planned Install Date: (Last day of the year)
                  <br />Classification: Project <br />Deployment Type:
                  Move/Add/Change <br />Template: BF / Non BF (If the
                  instalation is covered, BF, if not, Non BF) <br /><br />If the
                  SNOW ticket is created for a troubleshooting/investigation
                  process by L2 DMB Support team, the following field in the
                  tempate should be changed. Program: DMB MAC Pre Order; After the technician is found, it's then changed to DMB Move Add Change.
                </p><br />
<p>Here is a description of what each status means in Snow: 
<br />⦁ Assignment group: <br /> 31 CCC Deployment = DMB MAC Deployment team <br />31 Brand Incident Management = DMB L2 Support team<br />
⦁ Overall Case State:<br />Starting = Creating a ticket<br />Scheduling = Scheduling a technician<br />Complete = Closing the ticket as completed<br />Cancelled = Ticket cancelled<br />
⦁ Program:<br />DMB MAC Pre-order = For L2 team while waiting for a quote for troubleshooting<br />DMB Move Add Change (MAC) = For the deployment team for an installation, or when quote is approved for t/s<br />
⦁ Planned Install State:<br />Deliverables Pending = Hardware not yet delivered<br />Customer requested = Hardware delivered, pending installation<br />Installer scheduled = Installer has been scheduled<br />Install completed = Installation completed<br />Revisit Pending = Waiting for a re-visit<br />Revisit Scheduled: Revisit requested
</p>
                <br />
                <h2>Completed without issues</h2>
                <p>
                  These tickets are the ones completed without issues, and a pick-up can be done, along with closure of the Snow&Atos tickets completly.  
Stratacache equipment is not scheduled by us, but returned by the customer using a return label, where Coates equipment return is requested by us.   <br />
 <br />
To search for these tickets, in All Cases in Snow, set filters to:  <br />
Program => is => DMB Move Add Change <br />
Report Status => is => Completed Without Issues <br />
Overall Case State => is not => Completed <br />
Planned Install Date => on => This month <br />
 <br />
To close these tickets out, after verifying everything is as it should be, a pick-up should be requested through the Samsung portal for Samsung screens, and Atos ticket updated with “Displays have been replaced successfully, without issues, pick-up has been requested for the old screens, ticket can be closed”.  
For Stratacache equipment, where order was made, the pick-up step can be ignored, and Atos ticket should be updated with:  
“Hardware replaced successfully, without issues, ticket can be closed”. <br />
The same note should be left in Snow case, and also Closure Information, and when scrolled all the way to the bottom, change the State of the Deployment Tasks to Cancelled. 
Then, the Overall case state can be changed to Complete, and updated through the Update button.
