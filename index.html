                  DMB Support team is involved with all of the hardware within a
                  McDonald's Drive-Thru Digital Menu Boards (later on mentioned
                  as DMB) enclosures, and indoor DMBs. <br />
                  Hardware that every DMB screen contains is as follows:<br />
                  -Enclosure/Enclosure case (for Outdoor drive-thru boards)<br />
                  -Display (either 49" LG screen indoor, or a 55" AUO/LG or 55"
                  Samsung outdoor screen) <br />
                  -Media Player (for each Display, one Media Player is
                  assigned)<br />
                  -HDMI Cables (from the Media Player to the Display)<br />
                  -RS232 Cables (from the Media Player to the Display)<br />
                  -Network Cables (CAT6 cables from the Media Player to
                  Switches)<br />
                  -Power Supply Unit (PSU) & Power cables
                  <br /><br />Additionally, enclosures can contain different
                  parts depending on the type of the enclosure (Stratacache or
                  Coates, which will be explained later on). Coates enclosure
                  issues which are physical damage issues are handled by Coates,
                  with an exception for Vermin Barriers. Stratacache enclosures
                  also contain the following hardware, which can be replaced
                  after new parts are quoted: <br />-Fan trays <br />-Filters
                  <br />-Door/Enclosure struts <br />-Vermin barriers

                  Indoor displays are always 49" LG screens, with various
                  layouts: <br />

                  3 Displays (new store layout, one screen is a merchendiser,
                  two regular screens) <br />
                  5 Displays (classic layout, 5 screens numbered 1 to 5 from
                  left to right, all alligned on one wall) <br />
                  For Indoor media players, 150ft of CAT6 network cable is
                  needed. <br /><br />
                  Picture above is the most usual IDMB Layout.

                  Outdoor screens are 55" screens, within a protected enclosure.
                  <br />
                  Depending of the location of the enclosure, enclosures have
                  one or two Displays within the enclosure. The numbers for the
                  Outdoor DMBs start with 11, and go up to 16. <br />Lane 1
                  single-screen enclosure = Display 11 <br />Lane 1
                  double-screen enclosure left screen = Display 12 <br />Lane 1
                  double-screen enclosure right screen = Display 13 <br />Lane 2
                  single-screen enclosure = Display 14 <br />Lane 2
                  double-screen enclosure left screen = Display 15 <br />Lane 2
                  double-screen enclosure right screen = Display 16
                  <br /><br />There are three different layouts for the outdoor
                  screens: <br />-Two lanes, one single screen (presell) and a
                  double-screen enclosure (drive-thru), this is the most usual
                  layout which is to be expected. <br />-One lane, one single
                  screen (presell) and a double-screen enclosure (drive-thru),
                  this is just a store with a single Drive-thru lane. <br />-One
                  lane, one single screen (presell) and two double-screen
                  enclosures, this is called a Tandem layout. <br />Outdoor
                  enclosures and screens are either Stratacache or Coates ODMB
                  enclosures, which are not compatible with eachother,<br /><br />
                  Stratacache enclosures are either old LG 55" screens, or new
                  AUO 55" screens, while they go into the same enclosures, LG
                  and AUO should not be mixed, as it may impact the
                  functionallity. <br />If the Display 14 (single-screen in Lane
                  2) is an LG screen, along with Display 15 (double-screen in
                  Lane 2, left side), and a Display 16 (double-screen in Lane 2,
                  right side) has a new AUO screen delivered, it should be
                  swapped with 14, to keep LG screens in the same enclosure.<br /><br />
                  Coates enclosures are always Samsung 55" screens, and Out of
                  Warranty requests for a new screen are done by Coates, with an
                  exception on if the customer has an NCR Break&Fix contract.<br />
                  In-warranty replacement is handled by NCR. Both enclosures
                  have their own different parts and PIDS, according to the
                  enclosure they belong to. <br />For an example,
                  <br />HPWR-601091 - NG-2 MP power supply [Stratacache Power
                  Supply Unit] <br />7182-K273-V001 ODMB Media Player PSU
                  Replacement Kit ODMB 4020150005-00 [Coates Power Supply Unit]
                  <br />An example of what a single-screen Coates enclosure
                  looks like: <br />
                  <img src="images/odmbSingleScreenM.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
                  All of the Displays, both indoor and outdoor, have their own
                  assigned Media Players. <br />
                  <img src="images/odmpMediaPlayer.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
                  For outdoor enclosures, 250ft of Cat6 rated cable is needed,
                  per cable. For every Media Player, two network cable runs are
                  needed, one on Primary one on Secondary, so 500ft in total.
                  For these, a professional installation is needed.
