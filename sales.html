                <p>
                  Sales requests are received through an Atos ticket, once it is
                  assigned to VDR:NCR-DMB.<br />
                  The request for the Sales ticket will be in Atos in the work
                  notes/comments, and it should look as following:
                  <img src="images/sales.png" /> <br />With this information,
                  the L2 DMB Support team sends an email to the MCE Team (orders
                  team, with the support team being in CC, along with the
                  Backlog Team), and adds additional information and hardware,
                  if needed. <br />The information added should be:
                  <br />-Vermin barriers and any additional hardware requested
                  in the request, mentioned in the first part of the Sales
                  request. <br />-Installation fee, if the customer does not
                  have coverage on their Break and Fix contract. Its calculated
                  after all of the hardware has been added, and its inserted
                  below the OOW Hardware part of the email. <br />Upon sending,
                  Atos ticket is closed with the appropriate note.<br /><br />When
                  the quote is sent and approved, a SNOW Case will be created,
                  which will be assigned to the Installation/Deployment team for
                  tracking and replacement.
