                </header>
                <p>
                  To create a ticket, we would first need to open a Neos
                  Incident.
                  <br />
                  To open one, in Neos, select Smart recorder tab, and in the
                  newly opened tab, in the field thats now opened for
                  population, add the stores FUA number with the format “@FUA”
                  and select the store that is now opened. The stores FUA number
                  can be obtained through a Master Restaurant List.
                  <br />
                  Once the store is selected, change the name of the subject to
                  “NSN (store number) / ODMB Display 11 troubleshooting” or
                  whatever the scope of work should be.
                  <br />
                  Scroll down and select the appropriate template, here are the
                  most commonly used:
                  <br />
                  1666-7165-8801 / standard tech resource => Standard technician
                  for t/s & mp/cable replacement
                  <br />
                  1666-7173-8801 / 2 to 43-55" Outdoor DMB => Two technicians
                  for screen replacement
                  <br />
                  Once that is selected, press the “Create Ticket” button, and
                  select Create incident.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A new page will be opened, where we need to change “Status” at
                  the top of the page to In Progress, and then scroll down to
                  the middle of the page, where we change “SN Override” to No,
                  and Serial number to “N/A”, and keep scrolling to the part
                  where it says “Assigned to: None set”. Press Assign to me, and
                  in the right part of screen, a pop-up will show up, where we
                  should select our name, with the NCR Corporations > Support >
                  DMB SUPPORT tag, and then press Assign.
                  <br />
                  After Neos ticket is created, scroll all the way down to
                  Tasks, and select “Add task” .
                  <br />
                  In the new Pop-up, select HSR Dispatch and Done. Open the new
                  task, press “Edit” in the top-right corner.
                  <br />
                  Change the Status to Assigned, and then scroll down to Failure
                  Reason, where we enter “%%%”, which will allow us to select No
                  reason entered. OOS should be Yes if the customer will be
                  charged, No if the customer shouldnt be charged, and OOS
                  Reason “T&M charge” if they are being charged, and “N/A” if
                  not.
                  <br />
                  Last step in Neos is to select Submit HSR Dispatch, and select
                  Yes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, a new Dispatch will be created in the Dispatchboard, it
                  can be located through the “Site Name” row, which should
                  contain the NSN of the site. <br />In the dispatch, press
                  “Take Ownership” and go to Tech & FSL tab, where we will
                  select NCR CE, and circle the assign button. <br />Once that
                  is done, go back to Work Order Info tab, and enter the desired
                  ETA of the installation in the Tech ETA grey field. Then, open
                  Work Order Notes, and select “Create Note”, where we will add
                  a template containing ETA,SOW etc. <br />Once that is
                  completed, press Save, and go to New NCR dispatch, where we
                  will change the bottom “Initial remarks” field, with a
                  template for a technician. Once that is completed, press Send
                  to NCR. Then, press cancel, and check what the “View Work
                  Order” number is in the title, and check for an EPS email to
                  get sent to your team, containing that work order number.
                  <br />Send an email to the appropriate field nation, edit the
                  template, and proceed with informing the customer.
                </p>
                <h2>Quickbase/PSV</h2>
                <h3>A guide on PSV Incident creation</h3>
                <p>
                  For larger visits, and also cabling visits, PSVs are created.
                  To create them, we operate through the QuickBase and select
                  Project Sites. <br />In the “Search these Project Site
                  records”, type the store number, and enter. <br />Select
                  “McDonalds DMB MAC” option, and locate the store by the CDM
                  Sites / Site Number row. When located, press the Eye icon, if
                  the store is not on the list, press the blue button “New
                  Project Site”, and enter 746 in the first field, and the
                  stores FUA in the second field. Once the stores Project Site
                  is opened, scroll down to Add Task, and select it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Populate Related Template Task with “L2 Cabling” option or
                  “Replace Outdoor Display / Stratacache”, scroll down and
                  populate “First Scheduled Date, Last Scheduled Date, Earliest
                  Start Time, Latest Start Time”. <br />Then, scroll down and
                  populate “Work Order Notes Override” with the template for
                  PSVs, and press save. Then, after Task is created, send a
                  message to the McD DMB Phase 2 group, stating “NSN (store
                  number) - PSVs created”. <br />Then, track the ETA through the
                  next couple of days.
